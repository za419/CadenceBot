`Many years ago, the pope declared that all Jews had to leave Italy. The Jews were obviously upset by this, and they rather loudly protested. The pope declared that, if the Jews could get their wisest rabbi to win in a debate against him, they could stay in Italy.
The Jews searched far and wide for their wisest rabbi, and eventually, they found him. The only problem was, the rabbi didn't speak Italian, and the pope didn't speak Hebrew. So they decided to have a silent debate. 
They sit at the table, and the pope, being the pope, goes first. He holds up three fingers, and the rabbi holds up one. He holds his finger up, and waves it all around his head, and the rabbi points at the ground. He takes out the bread and wine of the Eucharist, and the rabbi takes out an apple. With that, the pope declares that he has been defeated, and that the Jews can stay in Italy.                     
Shortly afterward, the pope is visiting with his bishops, who have come to see the event, and they say "we didn't understand any of that! What happened?", to which he replies, "well, first I held up three fingers, to remind him of the Holy Trinity, and he held up one, to remind me that there is only one God. Then, I waved my finger around, to remind him that God is all around us, and he pointed at the ground, to remind me that God is right here with us. Finally, I took out the bread and wine, to remind him of our savior, and he took out an apple, to remind me of the original sin. And I had no way to top that." 
Meanwhile, the Jews have asked the same question of their rabbi, to which he says, "well, first he said that we had three days to leave, so I gave him the finger. Then, he said all of us had to leave, and I said we were staying right here. Then he took out his lunch, so I took out mine!"`,
`A priest and a nun go golfing. The priest lines up his putt, adjusts his lucky cap, takes a deep breath, and swings! And misses. 
"Damn!" he shouts.
The nun is scandalized and warns the priest-'Father! Watch your language!' The priest apologizes and decides to move onto the next hole.
He lines up his shot, adjusts his lucky cap, takes a deep breath, and...swings! This time the ball falls into a lake. 
He throws his club down, screaming 'Dammit!'
The nun admonishes him, 'Father-you had better watch your language, or the Lord may strike you down!' 
Again the priest apologizes and decides to move onto the next hole.
The priest lines up his shot, he adjusts his lucky cap and focuses intently on the ball. He takes a deep breath. He swings! This time, the ball lands in a sandtrap. 
'DAMMIT DAMMIT DAMMIT!' he screams.
The sky darkens as billowy storm clouds rush in. Suddenly, BOOM, a bolt of lightning strikes the green! 
The nun lies dead as a doornail as the priest gawks to the side.
A rumbling voice from the heavens:
"Dammit!"`
