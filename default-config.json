            "Many years ago, the pope declared that all Jews had to leave Italy. The Jews were obviously upset by this, and they rather loudly protested. The pope declared that, if the Jews could get their wisest rabbi to win in a debate against him, they could stay in Italy.\nThe Jews searched far and wide for their wisest rabbi, and eventually, they found him. The only problem was, the rabbi didn't speak Italian, and the pope didn't speak Hebrew. So they decided to have a silent debate.\nThey sit at the table, and the pope, being the pope, goes first. He holds up three fingers, and the rabbi holds up one. He holds his finger up, and waves it all around his head, and the rabbi points at the ground. He takes out the bread and wine of the Eucharist, and the rabbi takes out an apple. With that, the pope declares that he has been defeated, and that the Jews can stay in Italy.\nShortly afterward, the pope is visiting with his bishops, who have come to see the event, and they say \"We didn't understand any of that! What happened?\", to which he replies, \"Well, first I held up three fingers, to remind him of the Holy Trinity, and he held up one, to remind me that there is only one God. Then, I waved my finger around, to remind him that God is all around us, and he pointed at the ground, to remind me that God is right here with us. Finally, I took out the bread and wine, to remind him of our savior, and he took out an apple, to remind me of the original sin. And I had no way to top that.\"\nMeanwhile, the Jews have asked the same question of their rabbi, to which he says, \"Well, first he said that we had three days to leave, so I gave him the finger. Then, he said all of us had to leave, and I said we were staying right here. Then he took out his lunch, so I took out mine!\"",

And misses.\n\"Damn!\" he shouts.\nThe nun is scandalized and warns the priest-'Father! Watch your language!' The priest apologizes and decides to move onto the next hole.\nHe lines up his shot, adjusts his lucky cap, takes a deep breath, and...swings! This time the ball falls into a lake. \nHe throws his club down, screaming 'Dammit!'\nThe nun admonishes him, 'Father-you had better watch your language, or the Lord may strike you down!'\nAgain the priest apologizes and decides to move onto the next hole.\nThe priest lines up his shot, he adjusts his lucky cap and focuses intently on the ball. He takes a deep breath. He swings! This time, the ball lands in a sandtrap. \n'DAMMIT DAMMIT DAMMIT!', he screams.\nThe sky darkens as billowy storm clouds rush in. Suddenly, BOOM, a bolt of lightning strikes the green!\nThe nun lies dead as a doornail as the priest gawks to the side.\nA rumbling voice from the heavens:\n\"Dammit!\""
