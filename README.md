**CadenceBot** is a [Discord](https://discordapp.com/) bot client for a [Cadence Radio](https://github.com/kenellorando/cadence) stack. 

It allows you to control your station through a Discord server and even listen to the radio in voice channels! CadenceBot is fully featured and functionally equivalent to the [web client](http://cadenceradio.com/).

## Install CadenceBot

1. [Get your token from Discord](https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc/wiki/Creating-a-discord-bot-&-getting-a-token) and save it somewhere.
2. Run the script `first-time-setup.sh`. This will prompt you for an (optional) email to deliver bot logs to and the Discord token you saved in the previous step.
3. Run `restart.sh` or `node bot.js` and your instance of CadenceBot will start running.

If at any point you need to recreate this setup to change configured parameters, you may simply rerun `first-time-setup.sh`.
